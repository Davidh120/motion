This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (>= 12.0.0)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Davidh120/motion.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd motion

3.Install project dependencies:

    npm install

    # Or, if you prefer using yarn
    yarn

4.To start the development server, use the following command:

    npm run dev

    # Or, if you prefer using yarn
